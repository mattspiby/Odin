            <h1>Learning to Code 101: Building the Foundations from the Odin Project</h1>
            <p>Always had the urge to learn code but never committed the time. <b>Why?</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            That's a question i'll never understand. You look back at the time spent winging life<br>
            and dossing about like time isn't precious. It's taken about 15 years' to understand<br>
            that there's so much to accomplish in life and until you put the effort in, thats<br>
            when you'll see the rewards.</p>
